# Tour de France 2022 Rest-API.

This project is my backend for my exam project 2022. It is a full-stack application build in Java, with the Spring framework and a MYSQL database.

There is Postman Script included for testing CRUD in the docs/postman folder.

## Steps to Setup

**1. Clone the application**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tour-de-france-2022-eksamen/Tour-de-france-rest-api.git
```

**2. Create Mysql database**
```bash
create database tourdefrance2022
```

**3. Change mysql username and password as per your installation**

+ open `src/main/resources/application.properties`
+ change `spring.datasource.username` and `spring.datasource.password` as per your mysql installation

**4. Run the Rest-API using maven**

```bash
Run/compile app in your local IDE

or

mvn spring-boot:run
```
The app will start running at <http://localhost:8080>
